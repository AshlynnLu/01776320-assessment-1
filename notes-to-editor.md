# Notes to editor

The final ouput is an article of 200-300 words with 4 supporting data visualisations, following the style guidelines of The Economist as closely as possible. The plots in the article follow the instructions for web visualisations. 

The guidelines which are met:
- The font "Econ Sans Cnd" regular, medium, and light
- The color and font sizes used in the plots
- The position of title, subtitle, caption, axis, legend
- The axis, legend, grid lines for each plot
- The watermark (red line and red rectangle) on the top of each plot


The guidelines which are not met:

Overall:
- The margins are not strictly follows the guidelines
- The font "Econ Sans Bold" is not available on my laptop, so I use "Source Sans Pro Bold" instead

Line plot:
- The y-axis value should be on top of the gird line

Donut chart:
- The margins of the donut chart are not following the guideline
- Add legend to every facet donut chart with the value of each county on the label

Map:
- The legend keys are a bit higher than the legend title
- The margin around the map cannot be removed


Since there are some unclear instructions in the guideline, there may be any alterations I would make with the assistance of the magazineâ€™s team of experienced data journalists:
- Solve the above unsatisfied guidelines
- Adjust the line thickness for line graph
- Adjust the column width of the bar plot
- For the population map, add labels to counties which has higher population than others
