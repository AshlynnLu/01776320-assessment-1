# Notes to editor

The final ouput is an single, full page (20x24cm) infographic, following the style guidelines of The Economist as closely as possible. The plots in the infographic follow the instructions for web visualisations. 

The guidelines which are met:
- The font "Econ Sans Cnd" regular, medium, and light
- The color and font sizes used in the plots
- The watermark (red line and red rectangle) on the top of each plot
- The axis, legend, grid lines for each plot


The guidelines which are not met:

Overall:
- The margins are not precise
- The font "Econ Sans Bold" is not available on my laptop, so I use "Source Sans Pro Bold" instead

Line plot:
- The y-axis value should be on top of the gird line

Donut chart:
- The margins of the donut chart are not following the guideline
- Add legend to every facet donut chart with the value of each county on the label

Map:
- The legend keys are a bit higher than the legend title


Since there are some unclear instructions in the guideline, there may be any alterations I would make with the assistance of the magazineâ€™s team of experienced data journalists:
- Solve the above unsatisfied guidelines
- Adjust the line thickness for line graph
- Adjust the column width of the bar plot
- For the population map, add labels to counties which has higher population than others
